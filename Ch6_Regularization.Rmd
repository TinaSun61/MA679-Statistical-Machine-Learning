### Ames Housing data

Please take a look at the Ames Hoursing data.
```{r}
library(AmesHousing)
?ames_raw
```

### Questions

Use data of `ames_raw` up to 2008 predict the housing price for the later years.
```{r,echo=show_code}
ames_raw_2008=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`<2008,]
ames_raw_2009=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`>=2008,]
```

Use the same loss function calculator.
```{r,echo=show_code}
calc_loss<-function(prediction,actual){
  difpred <- actual-prediction
  RMSE <-sqrt(mean(difpred^2))
  operation_loss<-abs(sum(difpred[difpred<0]))+sum(0.1*actual[difpred>0])
  return(
    list(RMSE,operation_loss
         )
  )
}
```

Here are few rules:

- You are not allowed to use the test data.
- Try 3 of the regularization methods discussed in Ch6.
- You should use a resampling method that is most appropriate for choosing the hyper parameters.

Your code:
Lasso
```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- model.matrix(SalePrice ~ `Gr Liv Area`  + `1st Flr SF` + `Year Built` + `Full Bath` + `Garage Area` + `Lot Area` + `Overall Qual`, ames_raw_2008)[, -1]
y <- ames_raw_2008$SalePrice

library(glmnet)
grid <- 10^seq(10, -2, length = 100)
ridge.mod <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0, lambda = grid)

set.seed(1)
train <- sample(1:nrow(x), nrow(x)/2)
test <- (-train)
y.test <- y[test]

cv.out <- cv.glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 0)
plot(cv.out)
bestlam <- cv.out$lambda.min
bestlam

new_x <- model.matrix(SalePrice ~ `Gr Liv Area`  + `1st Flr SF` + `Year Built` + `Full Bath` + `Garage Area` + `Lot Area` + `Overall Qual`, ames_raw_2009)[, -1]
ridge_pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s=bestlam, newx=new_x)
mean((ridge_pred-ames_raw_2009$SalePrice)^2)
calc_loss(ridge_pred,ames_raw_2009$SalePrice)

## Problem Set

### Best Subset

In this exercise, we will generate simulated data, and will then use this data to perform best subset selection.

(a) Use the `rnorm()` function to generate a predictor $X$ of length $n = 100$, as well as a noise vector $\epsilon$ of length $n = 100$.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1018)
x = rnorm(100)
e = rnorm(100)
```


(b) Generate a response vector $Y$ of length $n = 100$ according to the model $$\mathbf{y} = \boldsymbol{\beta}_0 + \beta_1X + \beta2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \epsilon$$, where $\beta_{0}$ , $\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$, and $\beta_{3}$ are constants of your choice.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
y = 1 + 2*x + 3*x^2 + 4*x^3 + e
```


(c) Use the `regsubsets()` function to perform best subset selection in order to choose the best model containing the predictors $X$, $X^{2},\dots,X^{10}$. What is the best model obtained according to $C_p$ , BIC, and adjusted $R^2$ ? Show some plots to provide evidence for your answer, and report the coefficients of the best model obtained. Note you will need to use the `data.frame()` function to create a single data set containing both $X$ and $Y$.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
data1 = data.frame(y, x)
regfit = regsubsets(y~poly(x,10), data = data1, nvmax=10)
regfit_summary <- summary(regfit)

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(regfit_summary$cp, xlab = "Number of Variables",
    ylab = "CP", type = "l")
plot(regfit_summary$bic, xlab = "Number of Variables",
    ylab = "BIC", type = "l")
plot(regfit_summary$adjr2, xlab = "Number of Variables",
    ylab = "Adjusted RSq", type = "l")
```

Your answer: We find that with Cp, BIC and Adjusted R2 criteria, 3, 3, and 3 variable models are picked respectively.

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(d) Repeat (c), using forward stepwise selection and also using backwards stepwise selection. How does your answer compare to the results in (c)?

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
regfit_fwd <- regsubsets(y~poly(x,10), data = data1, nvmax=10, method = "forward")
sumf <- summary(regfit_fwd)
regfit_bwd <- regsubsets(y~poly(x,10), data = data1, nvmax=10, method = "backward")
sumb <- summary(regfit_bwd)

which.min(sumf$cp)
which.min(sumb$cp)

which.min(sumf$bic)
which.min(sumb$bic)

which.max(sumf$adjr2)
which.max(sumb$adjr2)
```

Your answer: differnt solution given by different selection method.

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(e) Now fit a lasso model to the simulated data, again using $X$, $X^{2},\dots, X^{10}$ as predictors. Use cross-validation to select the optimal value of $\lambda$. Create plots of the cross-validation error as a function of $\lambda$. Report the resulting coefficient estimates, and discuss the results obtained.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(glmnet)

```

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(f) Now generate a response vector Y according to the model $$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{7}X^{7} + \epsilon,$$and perform best subset selection and the lasso. Discuss the results obtained.

### College

In this exercise, we will predict the number of applications received using the other variables in the College data set.
```{r}
data(College,package = "ISLR2")
attach(College)
```

(a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
train <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(College), replace=TRUE)
test <- (!train)

college_train <- College[train, ]
college_test <- College[test, ]
```

(b) Fit a linear model using least squares on the training set, and report the test error obtained.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm_fit <- lm(Apps~., data=college_train)
lm_predict <- predict(lm_fit, college_test, type="response")
test_error <- mean((lm_predict - college_test$Apps)^2)
test_error
```

Your answer:
The test error of the linear model fit is 984743.1.

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(c) Fit a ridge regression model on the training set, with $\lambda$ chosen by cross-validation. Report the test error obtained.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(glmnet)
set.seed(1)
##Set up matrices needed for the glmnet functions
train_x_mat <- model.matrix(Apps~., data=college_train)
test_x_mat <- model.matrix(Apps~., data=college_test)

#Choose lambda using cross-validation
cv.out <- cv.glmnet(train_x_mat, college_train$Apps, alpha=0)
best_lambda <- cv.out$lambda.min
best_lambda

#Fit a ridge regression
ridge_fit <- glmnet(train_x_mat, college_train$Apps, alpha=0)
#make predictions
ridge_predict <- predict(ridge_fit, s = best_lambda, newx = test_x_mat)
#test error
mean((ridge_predict - college_test$Apps)^2)
```

Your answer:
The test error of the ridge regression fit with a lambda chosen by cross-validation is 940970.9, which is lower than the linear model test error.

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(d) Fit a lasso model on the training set, with $\lambda$ chosen by crossvalidation. Report the test error obtained, along with the number of non-zero coefficient estimates.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
#Choose lambda using cross-validation
set.seed(1)
cv.out_l <- cv.glmnet(train_x_mat, college_train$Apps, alpha=1)
best_lambda_l <- cv.out_l$lambda.min
best_lambda_l

#Fit a ridge regression
lasso_fit <- glmnet(train_x_mat, college_train$Apps, alpha=1)
#make predictions
lasso_predict <- predict(lasso_fit, s = best_lambda_l, newx = test_x_mat)
#test error
mean((lasso_predict - college_test$Apps)^2)
```

Your answer:
The test error of the lasso model fit with a lambda chosen by cross-validation is 993741.7, which is higher than both the linear model test error and the ridge regression test error.
~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(e) Fit a PCR model on the training set, with M chosen by crossvalidation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value of M selected by cross-validation.


Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(pls)
set.seed(1)
pcr_fit <- pcr(Apps ~ ., data = college_train, scale = TRUE, validation = "CV")
validationplot(pcr_fit, val.type = "MSEP")
summary(pcr_fit)
#make predictions
pcr_predict <- predict(pcr_fit, college_test, ncomp=10)
#compute test error
mean((pcr_predict - college_test$Apps)^2)
```

Your answer:
The lowest MSEP with PCR dimension reduction appears to occur around M=10. 
Looking at the summary I also confirm M=10 has the lowest CV error (other than 15+ components, which I am not considering because that does not accomplish much dimension reduction).
~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(f) Fit a PLS model on the training set, with M chosen by crossvalidation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value of M selected by cross-validation.


Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
pls_fit <- plsr(Apps ~ ., data = college_train, scale = TRUE, validation = "CV")
summary(pls_fit)
validationplot(pls_fit, val.type = "MSEP")

summary(pls_fit)

#make prediction
# The lowest MSEP with PCR dimension reduction appears to occur around M=8. Looking at the summary I see M=9 has the lowest CV error, so I will try both and evaluate the better performing one.
pls_pred <- predict(pls_fit, college_test, ncomp = 8)
mean((pls_pred - college_test$Apps)^2)

#Make predictions using M=9
pls_pred <- predict(pls_fit, college_test, ncomp = 9)
mean((pls_pred - college_test$Apps)^2)
```

Your answer:
The lowest MSEP with PCR dimension reduction appears to occur around M=8. Looking at the summary I see M=9 has the lowest CV error, so I will try both and evaluate the better performing one.

So the best performing PLS model utilizes M=8, and its test error is 978534.3. This is the second best performing model, second only to ridge regression.
~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(g) Comment on the results obtained. How accurately can we predict the number of college applications received? Is there much difference among the test errors resulting from these five approaches?


Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
TOTALSUMOFSQUARES = sum((mean(college_test$Apps) - college_test$Apps)^2)
TOTALSUMOFRESIDUALS = sum((ridge_predict - college_test$Apps)^2)
1 - (TOTALSUMOFRESIDUALS)/(TOTALSUMOFSQUARES)
```

Your answer:
The model performance from best to worst is as follows (based upon test error): Ridge Regression (940970.9), PLS model (978534.3), linear model (984743.1), Lasso model (993741.7), PCR model (1682909). The test errors of PLS, linear, and lasso are fairly similar to one another, while PCR performs significantly worse and Ridge performs a little better. To say how accurately we can predict the number of applications received, let’s compute the ridge regression R-square value.

The R-squared for my best model (ridge regression) tells us I can explain 92.4% of the variance in Apps using this model. This is strong accurate predictive power.
~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.

### Features

We have seen that as the number of features used in a model increases, the training error will necessarily decrease, but the test error may not. We will now explore this in a simulated data set.

(a) Generate a data set with (p = 20) features, (n = 1,000) observations, and an associated quantitative response vector generated according to the model $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$$, where ($\boldsymbol{\beta}$) has some elements that are exactly equal to zero.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
set.seed(2021)

p=20
n=1000

X = matrix(rnorm(n*p),n,p)

b=rnorm(p)
b[1]=b[3]=b[5]=b[7]=b[9]=0

error=rnorm(n)

y=X%*%b + error

```

Your answer:

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(b) Split your data set into a training set containing (100) observations and a test set containing (900) observations.


Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
train=sample(seq(n), 100, replace=FALSE)
test=(-train)

x.train=X[train, ]

regit.full=regsubsets(y~., data=data.train, nvmax=p)
train.mat = model.matrix(y~., data=data.train, nvmax=p)
val.errors=rep(NA,p)

for (i in 1:p) {
  coefi = coef(regit.full, id=i)

```

Your answer:

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~
(e) For which model size does the test set MSE take on its minimum value? Comment on your results. If it takes on its minimum value for a model containing only an intercept or a model containing all of the features, then play around with the way that you are generating the data in (a) until you come up with a scenario in which the test set MSE is minimized for an intermediate model size.

Your code:
```{r,echo=TRUE}

Your answer:
I zeroed beta1, beta3, beta5, beta7, beta9 in the true model, and the best subset model, for which the test MSE is the lowest, is able to identity those variables and remove them from the model.

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.

### Stein's Estimator and shrinkage
So far, we have seen how least squares perform well, even in cases where true model is not linear.  Then the natural question we may ask is, can we find an estimator that is better than least squares?  Which @stein1956inadmissibility worked on, and later @james1961estimation improved upon, it is called the James-Stein estimator or just Stein's estimator.  

Stein's estimator is defined as \footnote{In general Stein estimator is $(1-\alpha)\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ for some positive number $\alpha$ less than 1.  }
$$\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{stein}=\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}\right)\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$$.

According to Stein, for $p>2$
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\parallel \tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{stein} - \boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}\parallel^2\leq E\parallel \tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS} -\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}\parallel^2
\end{eqnarray*}

To put it in simple English, the estimator obtained by shirking the LS estimator by $\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}\right)$ is a better estimator than LS.  This is puzzling if you think carefully about it, given that LS is BLUE. Also, there is not even a tuning parameter, the only thing that seems to matter is $\frac{\sigma^2}{\parallel \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}$.  The proof is not hard and you can find it at the bottom.  But the important takeaway message is that we can do better than LS by shrinking the estimates.

### Methods to Control Model Complexity

Regression is used for variety of problems 
  - prediction: stock price in the future
	- estimation: denoising, smoothing
	- understanding: figure out what variable(s) are important

Critical characteristic in all situation is that we want a generalizable model. Thus we often prefer a simpler model over a complex model (why?).  This principle is called Occam's razor.  (Note that a simpler model does not guarantee generalizability. )
What methods are avilable for us to control the model complexity?

For orthogonal $X_j$ $j=1,\cdots,p$, we can use the shrinkage method as we saw in the Stein estimator $$\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}\right)$$

Another method is to use a threshold.  There is hard thresholding, where we set all the coefficients that do not pass a certain threshold to zero.
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\beta}_j=\hat{\beta}_j1_{\hat{\beta}_j>\lambda}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\hat{\beta}_j & \mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid > \lambda\\
0 &\verb|otherwise|\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}
An alternative is a soft thresholding, where we combine shrinkage with hard thresholding.
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\beta}_j=sgn(\hat{\beta}_j)[\mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid-\lambda]_{+}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\tilde{\beta}_j=\hat{\beta}_j-\lambda & \verb|if |\mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid > \lambda\\
\tilde{\beta}_j=0 & \verb|if |\mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid \leq \lambda \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}

But what can we do in a more general case where $X$ is not orthogonal or $p$ is bigger than $n$?  One thing that is popular nowadays is to put a penalty or constraint on the model complexity.  The two most popular ways are the subset selection and shrinkage methods.

#### subset selection

Subset selection is most commonly done by restricting the number of none zero $\tilde{\beta}_j$ to be less than some constant $k$.  But solving that is unfeasible in when $p$ is large since it is N-P hard problem.   In the orthogonal $X$ situation, if we order the $\tilde{\beta}_j$ and choose $k$ largest subset selection is equivalent to hard thresholding.

#### Shrinkage
For general $X$ we can also perform shrinkage, the idea is to minimize $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2$ subject to some constraint.  When we set the constraint as $\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2<t$ the result is called the ridge regression.  Similarly, if we choose the constraint as $\mid\boldsymbol{\beta}\mid<t$, then the result is known as the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression.  It turns out that this constrained minimization problem can be generalized to minimizing an objective function of the form $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel_{L_p}$ where $\parallel \parallel_{L_p}$ is called the $L_p$ norm and $\lambda$ is the complexity parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage.

##### Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is used when you don't have collinearity in your predictor variables.  We can think of it as a constraint optimization under $l_2$ norm or shrinkage estimation. So for a general setting:

observation  | predictor 1     | predictor 2     | $\cdots$ | predictor p     | response 
-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|----------
1            | $x_{11}$        | $x_{12}$        | $\cdots$ | $x_{1p}$        | $y_1$
2            | $x_{21}$        | $x_{22}$        | $\cdots$ | $x_{2p}$        | $y_2$
$\vdots$     | $\vdots$        | $\vdots$        | $\ddots$ | $\vdots$        | $\vdots$
n            | $x_{n1}$        | $x_{n2}$        | $\cdots$ | $x_{np}$        | $y_n$
&nbsp;       | $\mathbf{X}_{1}$| $\mathbf{X}_{2}$| $\cdots$ | $\mathbf{X}_{p}$| $\mathbf{y}$
             
             
$$
\mathbf{X}=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{X}_{1}&\mathbf{X}_{2}&\cdots &\mathbf{X}_{p} \\
\end{array}
\right]\verb|, and |
\boldsymbol{\beta}=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\beta_{1} \\
\vdots\\
\beta_{p} \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

 To find the ridge regression estimate, we want to minimize the objective function of form $\left(\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2\right)$.  As constrained optimization, we want to minimize $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\beta \parallel^2$ subject to $\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2 \leq t$ constraint for some constant $t$.  
 

 
 Imagine a contour defined by $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$ with its lowest at $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$.  Now imagine a circle around the origin where the diameter is defined by a tuning parameter $t$ such that it satisfies $\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2 <t$.  Our solution can only be inside this circle.  Without any constraint on $t$, i.e. $t=\infty$ we will get $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ as an estimate that minimizes $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\beta \parallel^2$. But as t gets smaller, we depart from our $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ since the solution has to be within the circle.  Thus we can see that the solution we want is on the circle closest to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$, which is the point circle that touches the ellipse.  Equivalently, our solution can be thought of as shrinkage.  As t gets smaller, we are shrinking our $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$  toward zero on the diagonal line from $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ to the origin.

So lets solve for $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial }{\partial \boldsymbol{\beta}}\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2&=&-2( \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})X +2\lambda\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
&\Rightarrow&  -\mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{X}+\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} + \lambda\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=0\\
&=& \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} +\lambda I)=\mathbf{y}^TX\\
&=& \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} +\lambda I)^{-1}\mathbf{y}^TX\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence we see $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{ridge}=(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} +\lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1}\mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{X}$.

##### LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)

The idea of LASSO is similar to Ridge Regression. Using the same setting as before, the only difference is we want to minimize an objective function of the form $\left(\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda\mid \boldsymbol{\beta}\mid\right)$ or equivalently perform constraint minimization of $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$ subject to $\mid \boldsymbol{\beta} \mid\leq t$ constraint ($\mid \boldsymbol{\beta} \mid=\sum^p_{j=1}\mid \beta_j\mid$).

Geometrically speaking (for $p=2$ case) we want to find $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ that is closest to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ within the diamond shaped region that is $\mid \boldsymbol{\beta} \mid<t$.
Unlike $L_2$ norm $L_1$ norm has corners and edges which touch the contour of $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$ first most of the time.  This acts as the variable selector in high dimensional space.  Thus when we look at the solution path of LASSO, we see some coefficient take on value of zero.

 ![Lasso Image](Lasso.png)

As $t$ is increased, we gradually start to see more and more $\boldsymbol{\beta}$s coming into our model.  And this goes on until all $t$ is so big that the diamond shaped region includes $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$, in which case, all the estimates of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ becomes $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$.  Or conversely, if you decrease your $t$, to zero your estimated  $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ starts to get shrunk toward zero from $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$.  So you can see that we are doing shrinkage estimation. Then we want to choose $t$ so that we get the sparsest model with the lowest cross validation error.

### Proofs

#### Stein's lemma
We first need Stein's lemma.`
\noindent{\bf Stein's Lemma} 
According to Stein's lemma, for $Z\sim N\left(\mu,\sigma^2\right)$, $E\left[(z-\mu)g(z)\right]=\sigma^2E\left[g'(z)\right]$.
\subsubsection*{proof}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[(z-\mu)g(z)\right]&=&\int(z-\mu)g(z)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{-(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}dz\\
&=&-\sigma^2g(z)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{-(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\Bigr|^{\infty}_{-\infty}+\sigma^2\int g'(z)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{-(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\\
&=&\sigma^2E\left[g'(z)\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

#### Proof: Stein's estimator outperforms LS

We are ready to prove that Stein's estimator outperforms the least square's estimate.  We will denote for the simplicity $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS} = \boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best} =\boldsymbol{\theta}$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta} \parallel ^2&=&E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}\left( \beta_i-\theta_i \right)^2\right]\\
&=&p\sigma^2
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\Biggl|\Biggl|\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right)\boldsymbol{\beta} -\boldsymbol{\theta} \Biggr|\Biggr| ^2\right]&=&E\left[\Biggl|\Biggl| (\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta})-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}\Biggr|\Biggr|^2\right]\\
&=&E\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2+E\left[\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]-2E\left[ \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}, \frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta} \rangle \right]=(*)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $E\left[ \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}-\theta, \frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta} \rangle \right]$ can be simplified as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}_i-\theta_i)\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}_i \right] &=& E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}_i-\theta_i)\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \boldsymbol{\beta}_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \boldsymbol{\beta}_j^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}_i \right]\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Letting $\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \boldsymbol{\beta}_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \boldsymbol{\beta}_j^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}_i=g(x_i)$, we can use Stein's lemma. Hence
\begin{eqnarray*}
 E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}(\beta_i-\theta_i)\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \beta_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \beta_j^2}\beta_i \right]&=& \sigma^2\sum^p_{i=1}E\left[\left(\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \beta_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \beta_j^2}\beta_i \right)'\right]\\
&=&\sigma^2\sum^p_{i=1} E\left[\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}- \frac{(p-2)\sigma^2 2\beta_i^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\\
&=&\sigma^2E\left[\frac{p(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}- \frac{2(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\\
&=&E\left[\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore:
\begin{eqnarray*}
(*)&=&E\left[\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2+\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}-2\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\\
&=&E\left[\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2-\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\leq E\left[\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2\right] = p\sigma^2
\end{eqnarray*}
